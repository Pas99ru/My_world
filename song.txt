[Verse 1]
They'll say, no one can see us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom

[Chorus]
They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
[Verse 2]
They'll say the sun is dying
And the fragile can't be saved
And the cold, it will devour us
And we won't rise up and slay giants

[Chorus]
They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Yeah, baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong

[Bridge]
It takes a leap of faith
To awake from these delusions
You are the coder and avatar
A star

[Verse 3]
They'll say, no one will find us
That we're estranged and all alone
They believe nothing can reach us
And pull us out of the boundless gloom


[Chorus]
They're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
Baby, they're wrong
They're wrong
They're wrong
